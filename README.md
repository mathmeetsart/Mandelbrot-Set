# Mandelbrot Set

Welcome to the Mandelbrot Set repository! Explore the fascinating world of fractals and artistic visualization.
<br/><br/>

## Description

The Mandelbrot Set is one of the most famous fractals in mathematics, discovered by Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in the 1970s. It is a set of complex numbers that exhibits self-similarity and infinite complexity. The Mandelbrot Set is generated by iteratively applying a simple algorithm to each point in the complex plane.

For more information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

## Visual Appeal and Artistic Representation

The intricate patterns and stunning detail of the Mandelbrot Set make it visually captivating. Artists and mathematicians alike are drawn to its infinite complexity, using it as inspiration for various forms of artistic expression, including digital art and sculptures.
<br/><br/>

## Applications

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Mandelbrot Set has practical applications in computer graphics, image compression, and chaos theory. Its self-similar structure and fractal nature make it valuable for generating visually appealing patterns and textures.
<br/><br/>

## Code

Explore the code used to generate visualizations of the Mandelbrot Set. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as matplotlib and numpy.

### Requirements

- Python 3.12
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

### Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `mandelbrot_set_visualization.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required dependencies installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `mandelbrot_set_visualization.py`.
5. Run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python mandelbrot_set_visualization.py
    ```

6. The script will generate a plot of the Mandelbrot Set and display it in a new window.

### Customization

You can customize the behavior and appearance of the plot by modifying the parameters in the script:

- `CENTER`: Define the center point of the Mandelbrot Set.
- `MAX_ITER`: Define the maximum number of iterations for the Mandelbrot calculation.
- `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`: Set the dimensions of the image in pixels.
- `SCALE`: Define the scale of the image.
- `CMAP`: Choose the colormap for the visualization.
- `EXTENT`: Define the extent of the plot in the complex plane.

### Saving the Plot

You can save the plot as an image file by uncommenting the following line in the script:

```python
# plt.savefig("mandelbrot_set.png", dpi=1200)  # Save the plot as a PNG file with high resolution
```
